# ITI-Graduation-Project
Our Telecom Churn Analysis serves as our capstone project for the ITI Track Power BI Developer program. The primary objective of this project is to delve into the intricate world of telecom churn, shedding light on the underlying causes of customer attrition.

By uncovering the root drivers of churn, we recognize that this phenomenon is a complex interplay of factors. These factors can include customer dissatisfaction with services, enticing competitive offers from rival providers, and shifts in customer preferences.

Our ultimate goal is to provide telecom companies with valuable insights, empowering them to proactively address churn and, in doing so, improve their overall performance
