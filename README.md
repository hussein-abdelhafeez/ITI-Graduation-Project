# ITI-Graduation-Project-
Our project, a graduation requirement for ITI's Power BI Developer track, delves into telecom churn. We aim to uncover its multi-faceted drivers like service dissatisfaction, rival offers, and shifting preferences. Our goal is to empower telecom companies with valuable insights to reduce churn and enhance performance.
